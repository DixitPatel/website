<i>A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages - Ralph Waldo Emerson </i>

<br><h3>Howdy! </h3>
 Welcome to this corner of the internet I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science from University of Colorado Boulder. For the summer, I am interning at NCAR where I am working on optimization of the Weather Forecasting Model (WRF) using their latest Cheyenne Supercomputer. In the past, I worked as a Software Engineer in Tokyo at Rakuten, Inc. I am passionate about programming and have a keen interest in distributed and large-scale systems.<br><br>
