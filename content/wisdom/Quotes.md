I often come across inspirational content/quotes on youtube, blog posts, HackerNews, etc that I keep stockpiling into my Evernote. Below are tidbits from this diary of growing wisdom. Hope you like them!


* **Bill Gates**<br>
<blockquote>
 *The best way to prepare as a programmer is to write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written. In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating system. You’ve got to be willing to read other people’s code, then write your own, then have other people review your code. You’ve got to want to be in this incredible feedback loop where you get the world-class people to tell you what you’re doing wrong.*
</blockquote>

* **Andrei Ershov**<br>
<blockquote> *Programming can give us both intellectual and emotional satisfaction, because it is a real achievement to master complexity and to establish a system of consistent rules.*
</blockquote>

* **Maria Popova**<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arq4x4WDYvM">Do Lectures</a>.  I've always found her content on [BrainPickings](http://brainpickings.org/) to be very thought provoking.<br>
<blockquote>
  * *Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind.*
  * *Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time.*
  * *Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity.*
</blockquote>

 * **Eric Schmidt**<br>
  Transcript: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh804pcy5sc&t=1014s"> Stanford GSB Talk </a>
  <blockquote> *Say yes to things. I say this when people ask me for advice on how to organize themselves. Just say yes to things. Figure out a way to do it. Say yes to an   invitation to a new country. Say yes to learn new things. Even if it is out of your comformt zone, saying yes means you will do something different, something new and make a difference. It let's you stand out of the crowd, be an optimist, see the glass half-full. Yes is what keeps us all young.*
  </blockquote>

 * **Ralph Waldo Emerson**<br>
 <blockquote> *A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.*
 </blockquote>

 * **Leonardo Da Vinci** <br>
 <blockquote>
  *I shall not refrain from including among these percepts a new aid to contemplation which although seems trivial and almost ridiculous, is none the less of great utility in arousing the mind to various inventions. And this is, if you look at any walls soiled with variety of stains, or stones with variegated patterns, you will therein be able to see a resemblance to various landscapes graced with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains great valleys and hills in many combinations or again you will be able to see various battles figures darting about, strange-looking faces and costumes, and an endless number of things that you can finely distill into finely rendered forms. And what happens with regards to such walls and variegated stones is just as with the sound of bells, in whose peal you find any name or word you care to imagine.*
