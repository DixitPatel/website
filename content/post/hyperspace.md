If we humans have at-least the perception of the difference between matter and spacetime and even though we are far from being able to explain the workings of it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton">Gravitons</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory">Super String Theory</a>), wouldn't it also be worth putting efforts in understanding what allows us those perception in the first place ? And then go on to interpolate those to move to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension">higher dimensions ? </a><br>
Maybe we could develop an initial mathematical model based on the interactions between matter and spacetime as observed by us and use combination of HPC and Machine Learning to do simulations and inferences for alternatives and uncover other hidden knowledge ? <br><br>
