<i> Equations are for eternity. </i><br>

Equations are elegant. Their concise nature that captures the underlying complexity of a system to a degree that satisfies 'observed realities' are what scientists and mathematicians consider beautiful. A lot of discovery process for such equations, over the past, took approaches that combined mathematical modeling and computational sciences. Advances in High Performance Computing (HPC) greatly affected this process. In the HPC world, you start with a hypothesis, form a theory over the hypothesis, and additionally run experiments and simulations to build mathematical models that eventually might lead to discovery or newer ideas to explore. Part of the goal of HPC is to do this fast using supercomputers so that we can get more science done.

For e.g in Numerical Weather Predictions, mathematical models are developed based on laws of physics, chemistry, fluid dynamics, etc and used to simulate atmospheric conditions and the same models (which are referred to as having developed through first-principles) are further used for predicting weather conditions. These simulations can range from micro-scale in nature (eg Protein folding) to cosmic simulations. Numerical Analysis forms the backbone of such HPC systems.

But what if we can't find the right equations that govern a phenomenon ? How do we model the system and get closer to being right about how the system is going to behave in the future ? This interestingly is a question that sometimes only machine learning can answer but as a catch it cannot tell us why. Why and how did AlphaGo make that divine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol#Match_against_AlphaGo" style ="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline">move</a> against Lee Sedol ? One obvious approach when you can't find laws is to make rules! But the problem with building more and more rules is that it's a never-ending vortex where you can get to point where the system is overly-engineered and you can't keep up. And problem with law's is that sometimes they break because of crazy behavior. Bottoms-up machine learning (Deep Neural Networks) approaches are getting a lot of traction lately and a lot of engineering efforts are being carried out specifically to get the training part of neural networks much faster (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol#Match_against_AlphaGo" style ="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline">TPU</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol#Match_against_AlphaGo" style ="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline">GPU</a>) and the inference part, that relatively doesn't require as much expensive computing and precision can be done using CPU's. The next big wave in HPC I think (and evidently as well) is specifically going to be around solving this problem with better hardware and software solutions combined. The HPC world is good at top-down approaches whereas Machine learning world is good at the bottoms-up approach. It's so interesting that these two worlds are perfectly complimentary to each other and have the potential to solve very complex problems in the future!
